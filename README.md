# 🟡 Pac-Man Remake in Unity

A recreation of the classic **Pac-Man** arcade game built with **Unity** and **C#**.  
This project was developed as part of my learning in game development and serves as practice for implementing **game mechanics, collision detection, simple AI pathfinding, and scoring systems** in Unity.
